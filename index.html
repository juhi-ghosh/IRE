          <p>We are concerned with the task of Aspect Based
Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), where the goal is to identify the
aspects of given target entities and the sentiment expressed
towards each aspect in restaurant reviews. Also, we identify
the categories of the aspect term and the category polarity for
each review. Our approach is rule-based and we have come
up with various heuristics to solve this non-trivial problem.
When evaluated using SemEval-2014 dataset, we obtain decent
results for aspect based sentiment analysis.</p>

<p>In  recent  years,  the  explosion  of  social  networking  sites,
blogs  and  review  sites  provide  a  lot  of  information.  Mil-
lions  of  people  express  uninhibited  opinions  about  various
product  features  and  their  nuances.  This  forms  an  active
feedback which is of importance not only to the companies
developing the products, but also to their rivals and several
other potential customers. Sentiment Analysis is the task of
tapping  this  goldmine  of  information.</p>

<p>The  sentiment  regarding  a  particular  product  in  a  review  is
seldom explicitly positive or negative; rather people tend to have a 
mixed opinion about various features, some positive and some negative.
 Thus the feature specific opinion matters more than the overall opinion.</p>

<p>Consider a review:
__The food was good but servicing was a bit slow. 
This sentence has a mixed emotion. The emotion regarding food is<br>
positive whereas that regarding servicing life is negative.<br>
Hence, it is of utmost importance to extract only those opinions 
relevant to a particular feature (like food or service) and
classify them, instead of taking the complete sentence and
the overall sentiment. 
We present a rule-based approach that exploits common-sense 
knowledge and sentence dependency trees to detect both aspects, 
their categories, similarity and polarity score.</p>

<p>In this project, we developed a system that extracts potential features
from a review and clusters opinion expressions describing each of the
features. Eventually, it retrieves the opinion expression describing 
the user specified feature. The drawback of the system is that it cannot 
evaluate domain dependent implicit sentiment as it does not train on any
domain specific data. Thus the system will not be able to distinguish 
between:
The story is unpredictable(positive  sentiment) and
The steering wheel is unpredictable(negative  sentiment).<br>
This is due to the usage of a generic sentiment lexicon,
in the final stage, in rule based classification. Supervised 
classification can distinguish between the two sentiments but it
needs tagged data and separate training for every domain.
__This system can be further improved upon by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discovering more rules for aspect term extraction.</li>
<li>Combining existing rules for complex aspect extraction.</li>
<li>To extract aspect categories dictionaries created can be
made more noise free.</li>
<li>Hybrid  approach  or  supervised  classification  can  be
used for better performance.</li>
</ul>
