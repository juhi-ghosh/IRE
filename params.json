  "body": "We are concerned with the task of Aspect Based\r\nSentiment Analysis (ABSA), where the goal is to identify the\r\naspects of given target entities and the sentiment expressed\r\ntowards each aspect in restaurant reviews. Also, we identify\r\nthe categories of the aspect term and the category polarity for\r\neach review. Our approach is rule-based and we have come\r\nup with various heuristics to solve this non-trivial problem.\r\nWhen evaluated using SemEval-2014 dataset, we obtain decent\r\nresults for aspect based sentiment analysis.\r\n\r\n# _Present Day Scenarios..._\r\nIn  recent  years,  the  explosion  of  social  networking  sites,\r\nblogs  and  review  sites  provide  a  lot  of  information.  Mil-\r\nlions  of  people  express  uninhibited  opinions  about  various\r\nproduct  features  and  their  nuances.  This  forms  an  active\r\nfeedback which is of importance not only to the companies\r\ndeveloping the products, but also to their rivals and several\r\nother potential customers. Sentiment Analysis is the task of\r\ntapping  this  goldmine  of  information.\r\n\r\n# _Workarounds..._\r\nThe  sentiment  regarding  a  particular  product  in  a  review  is\r\nseldom explicitly positive or negative; rather people tend to have a \r\nmixed opinion about various features, some positive and some negative.\r\n Thus the feature specific opinion matters more than the overall opinion.\r\n\r\n Consider a review:\r\n_The food was good but servicing was a bit slow._ \r\nThis sentence has a mixed emotion. The emotion regarding food is  \r\npositive whereas that regarding servicing life is negative.  \r\nHence, it is of utmost importance to extract only those opinions \r\nrelevant to a particular feature (like food or service) and\r\nclassify them, instead of taking the complete sentence and\r\nthe overall sentiment. \r\nWe present a rule-based approach that exploits common-sense \r\nknowledge and sentence dependency trees to detect both aspects, \r\ntheir categories, similarity and polarity score.\r\n\r\n# _Brief Tour of the Project_ \r\n** Aspect Term Extraction **\r\n![Image1](https://github.com/juhi-ghosh/IRE/blob/master/ABSA_Web2py-App_Screenshots/ABSA_webapp1.png)\r\n![Image2](https://github.com/juhi-ghosh/IRE/blob/master/ABSA_Web2py-App_Screenshots/ABSA_webapp2.png)\r\n![Image3](https://github.com/juhi-ghosh/IRE/blob/master/ABSA_Web2py-App_Screenshots/ABSA_webapp3.png)\r\n\r\n** Aspect Category Detection and Polarity Results **\r\n![Image4](https://github.com/juhi-ghosh/IRE/blob/master/ABSA_Web2py-App_Screenshots/ABSA_webapp4.png)\r\n![Image5](https://github.com/juhi-ghosh/IRE/blob/master/ABSA_Web2py-App_Screenshots/ABSA_webapp5.png)\r\n\r\n# _Conclusion_\r\nIn this project, we developed a system that extracts potential features\r\nfrom a review and clusters opinion expressions describing each of the\r\nfeatures. Eventually, it retrieves the opinion expression describing \r\nthe user specified feature. The drawback of the system is that it cannot \r\nevaluate domain dependent implicit sentiment as it does not train on any\r\ndomain specific data. Thus the system will not be able to distinguish \r\nbetween:\r\nThe story is unpredictable(positive  sentiment) and\r\nThe steering wheel is unpredictable(negative  sentiment).  \r\nThis is due to the usage of a generic sentiment lexicon,\r\nin the final stage, in rule based classification. Supervised \r\nclassification can distinguish between the two sentiments but it\r\nneeds tagged data and separate training for every domain.\r\n_This system can be further improved upon by_:\r\n* Discovering more rules for aspect term extraction.\r\n* Combining existing rules for complex aspect extraction.\r\n* To extract aspect categories dictionaries created can be\r\nmade more noise free.\r\n* Hybrid  approach  or  supervised  classification  can  be\r\nused for better performance.\r\n",
